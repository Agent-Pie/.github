## 🧪 The Agent Pie Philosophy

Agent Pie is built for developers who want power without compromise:

- 💻 **Runs fully offline** – no cloud, no API keys, no internet needed  
- 🧠 **Use any local LLM** – Ollama, Mistral, LLaMA, whatever you prefer  
- 🔐 **100% private and secure** – your data never leaves your machine  
- 💸 **Free and open** – no subscriptions, no hidden costs, no SaaS traps  
- 🧩 **Modular & extensible** – use only what you need, or plug in your own agents  

---

## 🚧 Project Status

This is an **ongoing project**.  
I started with solving smaller problems via custom tools and agents.  
Now with **Agent Pie**, I'm **joining all those superpowers into one unified platform**.

Expect rapid iterations, new features, and continued development.
